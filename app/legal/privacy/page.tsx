      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p className="mb-4">Nena Mala ("us", "we", or "our") operates this website (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">What do we do with your information?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">When you purchase something from our website, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address. We need this information in order to process your payment and ship your order.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">When you browse our website, we also automatically receive your computer’s IP address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system. We use this to help us improve your shopping experience.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">If you opt-in to join our newsletter, we may send you emails about new products, events, sales and other offers or promotions. Any further information you choose to give us, such as date of birth or email preference, will only ever be used to help us provide you with a better experience.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Consent</h2>
      <p className="mb-2 font-medium">How do you get my consent?</p>
      <p className="mb-4">When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only. If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent or provide you with an opportunity to say no.</p>
      <p className="mb-2 font-medium">How do I withdraw my consent?</p>
      <p className="mb-4">If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at any time, by contacting us at privacy@nena-mala.com or writing to us at: Nena Mala, Avenida Costa, Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, 71980, Mexico (adresse illustrative).</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Disclosure</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service; however, we will never sell your information to a third party.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">E‑commerce platform</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Our store is hosted by a third‑party e‑commerce provider. Your data is stored in their data storage, databases and the general application. They store your data on a secure server behind a firewall.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Payment</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, your credit card data may be stored by our payment processor and encrypted through PCI‑DSS. Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction, after which it is deleted. All direct payment gateways adhere to PCI‑DSS standards.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Third‑party services</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">In general, third‑party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us. Certain providers (e.g., payment gateways) have their own privacy policies — we recommend that you read those policies.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Remember that some providers may be located in a different jurisdiction than you or us. If you proceed with a transaction that involves a third‑party service, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Security</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed. If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using SSL and stored with AES‑256 encryption.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Cookies</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">We use necessary, analytics and marketing cookies. You can find more information and manage your preferences on our <a href="/legal/cookies" className="underline">Cookies Policy</a> page.</p>

      <p className="mb-4">By using this site, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your state or province of residence, or that you are the age of majority and you have given us your consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use this site.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. Changes will take effect immediately upon posting on the website. If we make material changes, we will notify you here that it has been updated.</p>
